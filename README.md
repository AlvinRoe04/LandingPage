# LandingPage
A project to create a simple Landing Page with HTML and CSS. 

In this project, I learned:
-How to work with Flexbox, including Flex Containers and Flex Items.
-How text blocks work. Most of my issues came from the <p> blocks taking up so much space. I had to create a padding div to get the four images subtexts to arrange correctly. 
-This was a good refresher on selectors, and how cascading works. I enjoyed learning how chaining works with CSS. I was really confused about the difference between .className.secondClassName and .className .secondClassName at first. I'm used to most coding languages where white space is usually ignored. The idea that the space had significance was foreign. 
-I was stuck on this project until I began using the Devtools more. It sped up the workflow significantly.

What I need to work on:
-I'm unsure if using a div to pad was the correct answer. However, it became apparent why everyone uses frontend frameworks with this. There was so much bounching back and forth that there must've been some time loss there. I should see if preprocessors help with this. I should also see if there are better CSS practices that could improve this workflow.
-Responsive design. A lot of this is not responsive, and I would like to figure out best practices in that area.
